# dqn-tf

Deep Q Networks implemented in Tensorflow, mainly aiming to reproduce results from subsequent papers. Features from some of these newer papers on deep reinforcement learning will hopefully be implemented in the future.

Currently implemented:
- Vanilla DQN

Tentative list of potential features:
- Double Q-learning
- Bootstrapping
- Prioritized experience replay

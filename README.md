# deep-rl

Deep Reinforcement Learning in Tensorflow.
Aiming to reproduce results from interesting papers. Features from some of the newer papers on deep reinforcement learning will hopefully be implemented soon.
Later some personal novel techniques might be implemented

Currently implemented:
- Vanilla DQN

Being implemented:
- Double Q-learning

Tentative list of potential features:
- Bootstrapping
- Prioritized experience replay
- Asynchronous actor-critic
